# Project Costs

## Model Training Costs

The training dataset for each model was approximetly 70,000 images with an additional 10,000 held out for validation.

Using AWS Rekognition, the costs to train these models was as follows:

WIP

While this cost might be material for a hobiest project, for a comperation, this cost is signficantly cheaper than the Data Scientist cost to train a similar performance set of models.

## Live Runtime Costs

The majority of this architecture is serverless which means costs were fairly low while setting up the process. At scale, each image costs approximetly $X (WIP) to process.

That breaks down as follows:
