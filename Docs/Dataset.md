# Dataset

The dataset selected for this project comes from "BDD100K: A Large-scale Diverse Driving Video Database".

The dataset includes 100,000 images from a frontward facing camera with a wide variety modeling tasks. This includes tasks from the domains of image classification, object detection and image segmentation. This dataset was selected due to the sheer number of images available, the high degree of variety in the images, and the fact that one single dataset could be used for many different applicable tasks.

Below is a small sample of the types of images/labels available in the dataset.

## Additional Dataset History

The dataset was originally published in 2018[^1] with a total of 10 tasks available for future authors to test their machine vision models on. 

For the purposes of this project, an enhanced set of labels were used which were released in a follow project in 2020. WIP
