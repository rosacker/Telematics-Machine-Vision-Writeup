## Additional Models

### Driver Attention

WIP

See [Predicting Driver Attention in Critical Situations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06406) for motivating examples and data.

### Major Road Hazard

WIP

See [Detecting Unsigned Physical Road Incidents from Driver-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11824) for motivating examples and data.

## Multi-Image Analysis

One key area of improvement would be adding the ability to consider multiple images together. While the current solution only considers each image in isolation (i.e. "Is there a stop light in my view?"), the would be the potential to consider across multiple images and make more meaningful detections (i.e. "Am I approaching a red stop light quickly?")
